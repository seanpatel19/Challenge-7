# Challenge-7
ETF Analysis 

This challenge was to build a financial database and web application by using SQL, Python, and the Voilà library to analyze the performance of a hypothetical fintech ETF.

1. We used SQL queries with Python, Pandas, and hvPlot to analyze the performance of a single asset from the ETF.

2. We took the asset PYPL and used advanced SQL queries to optimize the efficiency of accessing data from the database.

3. Next we built the ETF portfolio by using SQL joins to combine all the data for each asset.

4. Finally, we used the Voilà library to deploy your notebook as a web application. You can deploy the web application locally on your computer.

## Examples

Unfortunately I could not get Voila to work, and for some reason my work crashes constantly on both Jupyter Lab and VS Code, so I cannot take screenshots of the hv_plots made on the challenge. Hopefully the viewer in Github will show that the work was done correctly

## Usage

To use the data simply clone the repository.

The a different asset could be analyised as well as the way the data was joined together 

Charts could also be changed to make things look different
